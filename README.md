## What is Reiki treatment and what are its benefits?

Reiki is a form of alternative therapy commonly referred to as energy healing.

It appeared in Japan in the late 1800s and is said to involve the transfer of universal energy from the palms of the practitioner's hand to its patient, relying on the latter's vibratory field.

Energy healing has been used for centuries in various forms. Proponents say it works because of the energy fields around the body.
There is some controversy surrounding Reiki, as it is difficult to prove its effectiveness by scientific means. However, many people who practice Reiki say that it works, and its popularity is increasing, so much so that Reiki is even practiced as a supplement in some hospitals.
